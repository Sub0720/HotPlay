# HotPlay
HotPlay is a lightweight, power-user extension that gives keyboard controls for any website that has &lt;video>. Use shortcuts directly while hovering over thumbnails, Shorts, or the player — no clicking required. Works in the mini-player, theatre, and fullscreen modes. Built for fast navigation, better volume control, and a cleaner playback workflow.
